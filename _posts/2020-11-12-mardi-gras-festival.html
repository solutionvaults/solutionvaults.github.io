For those who may not know, MARDI GRAS (New Orleans, Louisiana), also recognized as Fat Tuesday or Shrove Tuesday denotes the events of the Carnival celebrations. It is a reflection of the last night of feasting before the fasting ritual of the Lenten season. 
</p>

<p>
The celebrations begin on or after Epiphany, which is the Christiansâ€™ feast and reaches a climax on the eve of Ash Wednesday. The origin of this celebration is in medieval Europe between the 17th and 18th centuries.

On March 2, 1699 a French-Canadian explorer called Jeane Baptiste arrived at a place about 60 miles directly south of New Orleans and when his team realized that it was on the eve of the festive holiday, Jean named that place Pointe Du Mardi Gras.

Later on, New Orleans was formed around 1718 and Mardi Gras was openly celebrated here by the year 1730. During this time, the celebrations did not incorporate the parades as is known today. However, in recent years the popularity of small parades in the days immediately preceding the Mardi Gras festival have sprung up.

Interestingly, the word Mardi Gras is derived from the French language which means Fat Tuesday. In as much as debauchery and partying is associated with these events, it is impossible to overlook the religious, cultural and historical part of this celebration.
